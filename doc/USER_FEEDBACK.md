### Feedback Given to the Project ###

| ----------------- | ----------- |
| "I don't like how I can't close the prompt for choosing cards" | Think about other ways to prompt the user for cards that fit into the current design|
| "It would be nice to see the other player's cards." | Come up with a more clear method of specifying the number of cards in each person's hand (but not show them specifically, that is not the rules of Uno) |
| "It would be nice if the play turn button read "Play CPU Turn" when it was a CPU's turn to play". | On a CPU's turn, change the text on the play turn button to read "Play CPU turn"|
| Create a more intuitive splash screen | Make sure that all of the choices relating to a configuration file are on one side of the display, and all the choices related to starting a game from the UI are on the other. |
| Adding players with the same name | Still stick with the fact that you can't have multiple players with the same name, but introduce a check when configuration file parsing/adding new players via UI to ensure that no two playrs have the same name.
