Just looking over the information when I showed it to my partner,
I saw a lot of things that were weird and unnecessary in our API.
There are some classes also I see that could be brought closer together with 
inheritance. I also feel like my API would make more sense if we had fewer
methods that didn't return anything. This can make things more hard to understand
for a user. It was cool seeing the APIs of another group that is doing Uno.
They also have some different interpretations of the rules and have different
modifications than we have.
