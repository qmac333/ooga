## Game 1 - UNO
UNO is the classic UNO game. Players each have a deck of cards. The game should keep track of the number of players
in a game and the order of the game. There is a draw and discard pile. Players play a card based on the number and
the color of the most recently played card. There is a set order of the game, but it can go in reverse order by playing
a reverse card. There are action cards and number cards that players can play.

## Game 2 - UNO Blast
UNO Blast is played similarly to the original UNO, except there is a blaster in the middle of the table. Every
time a player has to draw a card, they put it in the blaster. The blaster has a certain probability of going off, though.
If the blaster goes off, it basically shoots all the cards in the blaster out. Whoever made the blaster go off by
putting a new card into it has to take all the cards that got shot out and put them in their own hand. If the blaster
does not go off when the player puts the card into it, then nothing happens and play proceeds as normal.

## Game 3 - UNO Flip
UNO Flip is also played similarly to the original UNO. However, there is a flip card that can be played. If the flip
card is played, then everyone's cards flip, including the draw and discard piles. There is a flip side to every card. So,
when you flip your cards, you will essentially be playing the same game that you were playing right before 
the flipped card was played, you and everyone else just have different cards now.
