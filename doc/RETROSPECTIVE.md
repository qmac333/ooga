# Lab Retrospective Discussion
### Drew Peterson, Quentin MacFarlan, Will Long, Paul Truitt, Andrew Sander

## Project's current progress
We feel that the project is currently on track. On the view side, we have implemented a splash screen where user's can change
the language and load a configuration file before starting a new Uno game. Upon starting a game, a new display screen is
created allowing the user to visualize all the players and their cards. For the controller, we have implemented configuration
file (JSON) parsing, using these parameters to properly initialize a new model object. Finally, on the model side we have
implemented a main class (GameState) that holds all initial game parameters and creates objects of Player and Card classes
in order to simulate the game. Additionally, we have made significant progress on the AI that will play the game against
the user. We still have significant work to do before the Basic version is complete, but each phase of the project has
made great progress and is mostly integrated with each other. We also currently have greater than 80% method and line coverage
across the project.

## Current level of communication
We feel that the level of communication is good. We have an active group chat where we have been able to discuss design choices,
ask questions, and help each other troubleshoot. We have also organized multiple meetings outside of class to code together,
making it much easier to make sure we're all on the same page.

## Satisfaction with team roles
Everyone on the team is satisfied with their roles. We have two people working on the backend, two people on the frontend,
and one on the controller. Each person is able to make their mark on the project while not being overwhelmed with work, which
is an ideal place to be.

## Teamwork that worked well

* The first thing that has worked well so far is our team structure. We were lucky enough to be in a team where everyone
had worked on both the front-end and the back-end during previous projects. That gave us the flexibility to assign roles
based on both interest and expertise. As explained above, we have 2 people working on the view, 2 on the model, and 1 on
the controller. This split up has worked great, as those on the model and view are able to pair program regularly and work
directly with someone else even outside on team meetings, and the person on the controller can focus on the integration/interaction
between the two sides. So far, this structure has worked great for us.

* The second thing that has worked well is our communication strategy. As mentioned above, we created a group chat for our
team where we can voice any ideas or questions to the larger team at any time. This has avoided multiple potential confusions
between team members. Furthermore, we meet outside of class multiple times per week to work on the code together, which
is normally much more efficient than working on our own.


## Teamwork that could be improved

* We could do a better job of defining milestones and working at similar paces. At times one phase of the project has gotten
ahead of the others, causing progress to be halted until the other phases have caught up. With that being said, this has
not been a major problem because we haven't had trouble hitting our high-level deadlines and everyone on the team has
different schedules, making exact synchronization impossible.

* We could also work on updating each other about progress in each phase. There have been one or two miscommunications about
the progress on the implementation of an API, causing small delays. Again though, this has not been a major problem and
in general our group chat is active with such updates.


## Teamwork to improve next Sprint
We have agreed to work on the first item above regarding our teamwork, although this corresponds closely to the second item
as well.
